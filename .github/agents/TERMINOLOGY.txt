# Agent Terminology and Standards Reference

**Purpose**: Ensure consistency across all agent instructions

---

## RFC 2119 Keywords

When used in agent instructions:

- **MUST**: Required, no exceptions. Failure to comply is a critical error.
- **MUST NOT**: Prohibited, no exceptions. Doing this is a critical error.
- **SHOULD**: Strongly recommended. Exceptions require explicit justification.
- **SHOULD NOT**: Not recommended. Doing this requires explicit justification.
- **MAY**: Optional. Use judgment based on context.

## Terminology Glossary

### Core Concepts

- **Value Statement**: Outcome-focused user story in format "As a [role], I want [capability], so that [value]"
- **Plan**: Implementation-ready document in `agent-output/planning/` directory
- **Analysis**: Research document in `agent-output/analysis/` directory
- **Critique**: Plan review document in `agent-output/critiques/` directory
- **Implementation**: Code changes and execution record in `agent-output/implementation/` directory
- **QA Report**: Test coverage and execution document in `agent-output/qa/` directory
- **UAT Report**: Value delivery validation document in `agent-output/uat/` directory
- **Retrospective**: Lessons learned document in `agent-output/retrospectives/` directory
- **Master Product Objective**: Immutable core product vision (user-only modification)

### File References

- Use format: `agent-output/[directory]/[file].md`
- Example: `agent-output/planning/016-feature-name.md`

### Status Values

- **Planning/Analysis/Critique**: Draft → In Review → Approved → Blocked
- **Implementation**: Not Started → In Progress → Complete → Failed
- **QA**: Test Strategy Development → Awaiting Implementation → Testing In Progress → QA Complete → QA Failed
- **UAT**: Pending → In Progress → UAT Complete → UAT Failed
- **Release**: APPROVED FOR RELEASE → NOT APPROVED

## Standard Engineering Fundamentals

All technical agents (Architect, Implementer, QA) apply these principles:

**Design Patterns**: Apply Gang of Four design patterns, SOLID principles, DRY, YAGNI, and KISS pragmatically based on context

**Clean Code Practices**: Write readable, maintainable code that tells a story and minimizes cognitive load

**Test Automation**: Comprehensive testing strategy including unit, integration, and end-to-end tests with clear test pyramid implementation

**Quality Attributes**: Balance testability, maintainability, scalability, performance, security, and understandability

---

## Escalation Framework

### Severity Levels

**IMMEDIATE** (within 1 hour):
- Blocking issue prevents all progress
- Technical constraint makes plan undeliverable
- Resource unavailable (API down, credentials expired)

**SAME-DAY** (within 4 hours):
- Agent conflict (contradictory guidance from 2+ agents)
- Value statement undeliverable as written
- Critical architectural misalignment

**PLAN-LEVEL** (before next milestone):
- Scope significantly larger than estimated
- Acceptance criteria cannot be verified
- Testing infrastructure unavailable

**PATTERN** (cross-plan tracking):
- Same issue recurring across 3+ iterations
- Process failure affecting multiple agents
- Quality gate consistently failing

### Escalation Targets

- **User**: Final decision authority on all matters
- **Escalation Agent**: Go/no-go decisions, agent conflict resolution
- **Planner**: Plan revision needed
- **Architect**: Architectural guidance needed
- **Analyst**: Deep research needed

## Standard Handoff Protocol

When receiving work from another agent, acknowledge with 2-3 sentence confirmation:
- Which plan/work you're receiving (Plan ID, version if applicable)
- Outcome of previous phase (approved, completed, findings)
- Your focus areas for this phase

**Example**: "Acknowledged - implementing Plan 013 v0.2.2. Critic approved plan with minor clarifications on test coverage. Focus: feature implementation, comprehensive test suite, value statement delivery."

## Test Deferral Policy

**Allowed ONLY when**:
- Plan explicitly approves deferral with documented rationale
- Planner creates future plan reference for deferred tests
- QA maps deferred tests to manual scenarios providing equivalent coverage
- Risk assessment documents impact of deferral

**NOT allowed**:
- Skipping tests because they're hard to pass (indicates design problems)
- Deferring without plan approval
- Missing test coverage with no manual alternative

**QA MUST document**:
| Deferred Test | Future Plan | Manual Coverage | Risk if Deferred |
|---------------|-------------|-----------------|------------------|
| test_foo() | Plan 017 | Manual scenario A validates same behavior | Medium - gap until Plan 017 |

## Architect Consultation Guidelines

**Analyst MUST consult Architect when**:
- Investigating root causes (not just symptoms)
- Research reveals architectural implications
- Multiple solutions exist requiring architectural guidance
- Issue may be symptom of deeper architectural debt

**Analyst MAY skip Architect consultation when**:
- Simple API behavior verification (documented behavior)
- Library capability checks (feature matrix comparison)
- Non-architectural research (deployment procedures, configuration)

**MUST document in analysis**:
- "Consulted Architect [date]: [key guidance received]"
- OR "Architect consultation not required: [justification]"
