# Deployment Instructions

Cognee Chat Memory releases in this workspace are **private** and must **not** be published to the VS Code Marketplace (or any external registry) until the user explicitly confirms the publication request at least twice in the same release conversation.

Operational rules:

1. Tagging/local installs may proceed after normal approval, but marketplace (or public) publishing is blocked until the user reiterates consent.
2. If confirmation is not provided twice, stop immediately, document the blocker in the deployment report, and wait for further instructions.
3. Do not infer consent from prior releases or historical approvals; each release requires fresh dual confirmation before publishing.

Keep this policy in mind for every future deployment task managed by the DevOps agent.
