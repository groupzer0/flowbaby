## Value Statement Validation
**Original Value Statement**: As a developer using RecallFlow (formerly Cognee), I want the system to accurately report when it cannot find relevant information and to reliably notify me if background processing fails, so that I can trust the tool's output and take corrective action when storage operations fail. Additionally, I want clear visibility into operation timing and a consistent brand experience.

## Implementation Assumptions
### Assumption 1: Log File Location
- **Rationale**: Storing logs in `.cognee/logs/` keeps them isolated and easy to find.
- **Risk if incorrect**: Users might not find logs if they expect them elsewhere.
- **Validation approach**: Verify log creation in the specified directory.
- **Escalation trigger**: User feedback or QA failure regarding log access.
